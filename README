Contains two plugins:
    1. send-cache is plugin for returning cache content to nagios. It may be
       called through NRPE and is, effectively, equivalent to passive plugins.
       The main drawback of passive plugins, is that it can update state of
       other (passive?) plugin, just by specifying it in
       PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT.  But by using "emulation" of passive
       checks with send-cache active plugin, i can avoid such situation.
    2. check-debian-restart is plugin for reporting does any service need
       restart (using Debian's `checkrestart` utility). There is wrapper
       script for `checkrestart` installed in /usr/local, which updates cache
       file (it should be called all the time instead of real `checkrestart`,
       otherwise cache file will not be updated). Also, apt hook is added,
       thus cache updates occur after apt run. And, finally, this cache file
       content reported to nagios using send-cache plugin through NRPE. Also,
       checkrestart wrapper tries to guess kernel upgrades. If either kernel
       has upgraded or real `checkrestart` reports at least one package
       requiring restart, wrapper tells "critical" to nagios. If only
       processes have been found, wrapper tells "warning".
