check-debian-restart is plugin for reporting does any service needs restart
(using Debian's `checkrestart` utility). There is wrapper script for
`checkrestart` installed in /usr/local, which caches checkrestart result using
write-plugin-cache from send-cache plugin (this wrapper should be called all the time
instead of real `checkrestart`, otherwise cache file will not be updated).
Also, apt hook is added, thus cache update occurs after apt have run. And,
finally, cache file content may be reported to nagios using send-cache plugin
through NRPE. send-cache plugin included here as git subtree .

Also, check-debian-restart tries to guess kernel upgrades. If either kernel
was upgraded or real `checkrestart` reported at least one package requiring
restart, wrapper tells "critical" to nagios. If only processes have been
found, wrapper tells "warning".

For now plugin work correctly only on Debian.
